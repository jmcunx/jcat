## jcat - slow down scrolling

This is a little utility will allow you to
slowdown scrolling.
Useful if you do not want to pipe information
through more(1) or less(1).

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, but this seems to be good enough for me.

**To compile:**
* If "DESTDIR" is not set, will install under /usr/local
* Execute ./build.sh to create a Makefile
* Works on Linux, BSD and AIX

_To uninstall_, execute
"make uninstall"
from the source directory
